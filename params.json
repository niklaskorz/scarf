{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"**Scarf** is a non-blocking web server for Objective-C, supporting both OS X and iOS.\r\n\r\n**Dependencies:**\r\n\r\n- Grand Central Dispatch (OS X 10.6 or newer, iOS 4.0 or newer)\r\n- New Objective-C literals (Clang 4.0 or newer)\r\n- [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n**Scarf** uses the MIT license. See [LICENSE](https://raw.github.com/dindresto/scarf/master/LICENSE) for more information.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nYou might have noticed that **Scarf** doesn't have any Xcode project files. Instead, you're encouraged to use [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods). Though you're free to copy the source files directly into your project (but keep in mind that you'll also need to add [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) yourself in this case).\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/dindresto/scarf/wiki) for examples and documentation.\r\n\r\n###With CocoaPods\r\nIn this case, you'll just need a Podfile in your project (see the [CocoaPods wiki](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/wiki) for more information) with **Scarf** as a dependency:\r\n\r\n\tpod 'Scarf', :git => 'https://github.com/dindresto/scarf.git'\r\n\r\n###Without CocoaPods\r\nMake sure that you also add [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) to your project. **Scarf** assumes that the CocoaAsyncSocket directory is in your header search path, so it can import GCDAsyncSocket:\r\n\r\n\t#import <CocoaAsyncSocket/GCDAsyncSocket.h>\r\n\r\nSo if you want to place it somewhere else, just make sure you change the import directives.\r\n\r\nProjects using Scarf\r\n--------------------\r\nFor now, this list is empty. Anyway, it would be nice of you to contact me if you use **Scarf** in one of your projects.\r\n\r\nOther platforms\r\n--------------------------\r\nIt may be possible to use **Scarf** on other platforms. Grand Central Dispatch is also available on [FreeBSD](http://wiki.freebsd.org/GCD \"Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) on FreeBSD\") and Linux ([Debian](http://packages.debian.org/sid/libdispatch0 \"user space implementation of the Grand Central Dispatch API\"), [source](http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/)), and you're free to port libdispatch to your favorite system, since it's [open source](http://libdispatch.macosforge.org/).\r\nAside of that, you'll also need a port of the [Foundation Framework](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/cocoa/reference/foundation/ObjC_classic/_index.html \"Foundation Framework Reference\"), like [GNUStep](http://www.gnustep.org/), and a compiler with support for the new Objective-C literals (Clang 4.0 or newer).","name":"Scarf","tagline":"Non-blocking web server for Objective-C","google":"UA-32952642-2"}
